NULL, default, *_join() perform natural join, using variables common across x y. message lists variables can check correct; suppress message supplying explicitly. join different variables x y, use join_by() specification. example, join_by(== b) match x$y$b. join multiple variables, use join_by() specification multiple expressions. example, join_by(== b, c == d) match x$y$b x$c y$d. column names x y, can shorten listing variable names, like join_by(, c). join_by() can also used perform inequality, rolling, overlap joins. See documentation ?join_by details types joins. simple equality joins, can alternatively specify character vector variable names join . example, = c(\"\", \"b\") joins x$y$x$b y$b. variable names differ x y, use named character vector like = c(\"x_a\" = \"y_a\", \"x_b\" = \"y_b\"). perform cross-join, generating combinations x y, see cross_join(). na_by columns match NA left Boolean control joins left (alternatively right) join","code":""},{"path":"https://ssi-dk.github.io/SCDB/reference/slice_time.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Slices a data object based on time / date — slice_time","title":"Slices a data object based on time / date — slice_time","text":"Slices data object based time / date","code":""},{"path":"https://ssi-dk.github.io/SCDB/reference/slice_time.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Slices a data object based on time / date — slice_time","text":"","code":"slice_time(.data, slice_ts, from_ts = from_ts, until_ts = until_ts)"},{"path":"https://ssi-dk.github.io/SCDB/reference/slice_time.html","id":"arguments","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Arguments","title":"Slices a data object based on time / date — slice_time","text":".data data frame, tibble, data.table tbl. slice_ts time / date slice from_ts name column .data specifying valid time (note: must unquoted) until_ts name column .data specifying valid time (note: must unquoted)","code":""},{"path":"https://ssi-dk.github.io/SCDB/reference/slice_time.html","id":"value","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Value","title":"Slices a data object based on time / date — slice_time","text":"object similar .data","code":""},{"path":"https://ssi-dk.github.io/SCDB/reference/slice_time.html","id":"ref-examples","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Examples","title":"Slices a data object based on time / date — slice_time","text":"","code":"conn <- get_connection(drv = RSQLite::SQLite()) #> Warning: No tables found.
